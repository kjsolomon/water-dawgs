# water-dawgs
Water Dawgs was a paid summer program designed to provide high school students, especially those from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM, with hands-on education in freshwater science and professional development opportunities. The program was created as part of the broader impacts of a grant that was funded by the National Science Foundation and was designed with three goals. First, it aimed to broaden local participation in summer STEM programs at the university by working with a local public school to recruit students from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields. Second, it aimed to enhance students' understanding of how environmental science issues relate to their everyday lives and future careers, even if those careers fall outside of STEM. Finally, the program sought to boost students' self-confidence in STEM disciplines, particularly in environmental science. 

Here, we provide all instructional materials for the Water Dawgs both in English and in Spanish. 

The summer training program includes the following materials:â€‹
- Program outline  
- Supply list  
- Pre-training instructor to-do list  
- Pre-, mid-, and post-training surveys  
- Student recruitment materials  
- Parent meeting materials  
- 17 learning plans (3.5 hours each)  

Each learning plan includes the following materials:  
- Instructor guide  
- PowerPoint  
- Student handouts
